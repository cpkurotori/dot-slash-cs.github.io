## Overview

Dot-Slash Computer Science, stylized as ./ComputerScience or ./CS, is the official computer science club at Ohlone College.

Born (officially approved) February 29th, 2016, ./CS aims to breathe life into the computer science department at Ohlone College. ./CS is a discussion-driven, project-oriented, career-building community. Our club officers strive to have club meetings centered around sharing important current events, techniques, and technologies in the industry as well as working on programming projects that give club members real-world experience with tools and languages that cannot be learned in a formal course at Ohlone College. We, as a community, also wish to offer a feeling of belonging such that our club members can bond as colleagues but also as companions. With that said, ./CS is proud to welcome any Ohlone College student interested at all in computer science. In other words, you do not have to be a CS major to join and/or attend our meetings.

If you are interested in checking out our club meetings and/or want to learn more about us, feel free to subscribe to our weekly newsletter!
