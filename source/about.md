# Overview

**Dot-Slash Computer Science**, stylized as **./ComputerScience** (or **./CS** for short), is the official computer science club at Ohlone College.

Born (officially approved) February 29th, 2016, **./CS** aims to breathe life into the computer science department at Ohlone College. **./CS** is a discussion-driven, project-oriented, career-building community. Our club officers strive to have club meetings centered around sharing important current events, techniques, and technologies in the industry as well as working on programming projects that give club members real-world experience with tools and languages that cannot be learned in a formal course at Ohlone College. We, as a community, also wish to offer a feeling of belonging such that our club members can bond as colleagues but also as companions. With that said, **./CS** is proud to welcome any Ohlone College student interested at all in computer science. In other words, you do not have to be a CS major to join and/or attend our meetings.

If you are interested in checking out our club meetings and/or want to learn more about us, feel free to subscribe to our weekly newsletter!

# Inspiration

The stylization, **./ComputerScience**, comes from Unix/Linux culture where a literal "./" is used to precede commands and/or serve as a relative file path. In other words, our founders are geeks.

In all seriousness though, the founders of **./CS** were driven to create and make this club flourish due to a number of unfortunate reasons regarding the computer science department at Ohlone College. To sum all of those reasons up concisely, Ohlone College's computer science department is sorely lacking.

Our founders could ramble on about their qualms with the system, but they wanted to highlight (and, with **./CS**, fix) a few important points about what actually constitutes the "lacking" qualities of Ohlone's CS department:  

> **Little to no classes that focus on more current technologies being used in the industry**

> **Few outside opportunities, jobs/internships, and techniques being introduced to CS students**

> **Low motivation/interest in the CS major among a large majority of the students**

**./CS** isn't going to point any fingers and it isn't that the CS department is completely at fault anyway--we simply want to fix these problems by doing our own thing in hopes that we inspire students to take their own initiative in learning. In this sense, **./CS** simply consists of Ohlone students who want to help other Ohlone students.

Many of us have been inspired to take learning into our own hands--we want to pass on this inspiration and hope that, in the future, all the problems will fix themselves. *That* is what **./CS** is inspired by.
